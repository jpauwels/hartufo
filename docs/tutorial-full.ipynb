    "As mentioned in the previous tutorial, the purpose of `hrtfdata` is to provide PyTorch [`Datasets`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) for multiple collections in a unified programming interface. What is not immediately apparent from using the `XPlane` classes, is that you can do more than simply load predefined datasets. The idea behind `hrtfdata` is that you can select any information contained in an HRTF data collection and combine them into a PyTorch dataset with your desired characteristics. It can be helpful to think of the classes in `hrtfdata.torch.full` as `Dataset` _generators_ and the classes in `hrtfdata.pytorch.planar` as predefined configurations of those generators (with added helper functionality like plotting etc.).\n",

    "To create a `Dataset`, you need to define its \"specification\", meaning that you need to tell what information you want to use as `features` and optionally what as `target` labels and/or as `groups`.

    "\n",
    "- collection: a string identifier of the name of the data collection\n",
    "- subject: an integer giving the identifier of the subject in the collection\n",
    "- side: a string indicating the side of the head \n",

    "- 3d-model: an array containing a 3D model\n",

    "\n",
    "The values for each of these keys are also Python dictionaries themselves, and allow to pass parameters for each type of info. The first three types `collection`, `subject` and `side` have no parameters, so an empty dictionary `{}` should be passed as value for these keys. The `hrir` type does allow to pass parameters in the form of a dictionary with the following keys:\n",

    "- domain: the HRIR/HRTF representation (`time`, `magnitude`, `magnitude_db`, `phase` or `complex`, default: `time`) \n",
    "- side: selecting a side of the head (`left`, `right`, `both`, `both-left`, `both-right`, `None`, default: `None` meaning any side available)\n",
    "- row_angles: a list of angles in degrees to select from the fundamental coordinate plane (explained later), default: all available\n",

The _fundamental_ plane of a coordinate system is the reference plane onto which each point gets projected. Its angles span a range of 360 degrees. The _orthogonal_ plane of a coordinate system is the plane defined by a point, its projection and the origin. Its angles span a range of 180 degrees. In practice, the fundamental plane will nearly always be the horizontal plane because only the CIPIC collection uses interaural-polar coordinates, all other supported collections use vertical-polar coordinates.\n",

The values of a single HRIR/HRTF (depending on the selected `domain`) for a particular position determined by row and column index are stored in the third dimension. The rows are ordered by increasing angle in the fundamental plane, constrained to the interval [-180, 180) (so vertical angles for CIPIC, azimuths for all the rest). The columns of the array are ordered by increasing angle in the orthogonal plane, constrained to the interval [-90, 90] (so lateral angles for CIPIC, elevations for all the rest).\n",
